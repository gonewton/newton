# Newton CLI Commands Skill

This skill documents the Newton CLI workflows and now includes the `newton init` command that bootstraps a workspace via `aikit-sdk` and installs the default `.newton/scripts` toolchain. After running `init`, `newton run` can be invoked without a path because it defaults to the current directory and picks up `.newton/scripts/<tool>.sh`. Use the reference files in this skill when you need reminders about running `init`, `run`, or the other workspace commands.
