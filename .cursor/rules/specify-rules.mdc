# newton Development Guidelines

Auto-generated from all feature plans. Last updated: 2026-01-19

## Active Technologies
- Rust (stable toolchain, focus on reliability and performance) + `clap` (CLI parsing), `tokio` (async runtime), `anyhow`/`thiserror` (error handling), `tracing` (structured logging), `serde`/`serde_json` (data serialization), `chrono` (time handling), `uuid` (execution IDs) (002-rust-newton-code)
- File-based artifacts and workspace state (no database required) (002-rust-newton-code)

- Rust nightly (as specified in rust-toolchain.toml) + clap (CLI), tokio (async), anyhow/thiserror (errors), tracing (logging), serde/serde_json (serialization) (002-rust-newton-code)
